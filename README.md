# joubini
Tool for managing configuration values with DynamoDB.  Named after O. joubini, the Atlantic Pygmy Octopus, because I couldn't find a species that has any connection to configuration management.

Includes support for both syncing environment variables across hosts using DynamoDB, and directly accessing configuration values to bypass environment variables directly
